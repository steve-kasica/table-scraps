    "## Querying the GitHub Search API\n",
    "\n",
    "In the spirit of journalistic transparency, many data-journalism articles are published in conjunction with computational notebooks detailing the analysis steps. These notebooks are usually under source code management with git and pubically available as repositories, colloquially known as *repos*, on GitHub. The [GitHub Search API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/) provies a convenient endpoint for unauthenticated, parameterized search across all user-uploaded repos on the site. To narrow-down results this notebook parameterizes search queires by tag and programming language. Many repos have user-defined keywords tagged with them to increase findability and discoverability on the site, and GitHub automatically analyzes the composition of programming languages used in a repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rate-limiting requests\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub's API allows 60 unauthenticated requests per hour. So running this notebook straight through will eventually run up against the rate limit, a 403 error. The `RateLimitError` class handles this case and exposes how many seconds remain until the rate-limit window resets. Many of the cells in this notebook will simply pause execution and wait how ever many seconds remain until the window resets. This notebook uses the [Freeze Jupyter Notebook extension](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/freeze/readme.html) to safeguard against cells making additional requests to the Search API after data has already been collected."
